# GoDL

godl is Go Deep Learning framework written on top of Gorgonia.
godl is to Gorgonia what Keras is to TensorFlow.

## API Stability
The API is not stable and can change at any moment.
I'm writing this framework mostly to learn and so I don't provide any guarantees
that it'll work for you. Use it at your own risk.

## Roadmap

The following items are in the current roadmap, some of them need to be implemented in Gorgonia first.

- [x] Data loader  
- [x] Base storage (save/load)  
- [ ] CLI to scaffold a project  
- [x] Embeddings  
- [x] LSTM  
- [ ] Bi-LSTM  
- [x] TabNet  
- [x] VGG16  
- [ ] VGG19  
- [ ] ResNet50  
- [ ] ResNet101  
- [ ] YOLO  
- [ ] CTC Losses  
- [ ] GroupNorm  
- [ ] LayerNorm  
- [ ] Face Detection

### Future

- [ ] Support ONNX  
- [ ] Support hdf5 files
